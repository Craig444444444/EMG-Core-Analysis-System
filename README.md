EMG Core Analysis System (advanced Artificial Narrow ? or general dependent on view) Intelligence) (101-Persona Collective Intelligence Engine)A web-based application that generates comprehensive multi-perspective analysis by orchestrating 101+ distinct AI expert personas through Google's Gemini API.OverviewThe EMG Core Analysis System transforms any topic or question into an exhaustive multi-disciplinary analysis by simulating consultations with 101+ specialized AI personas. Each persona—from First Principles Physicists to Urban Planners to Existential Risk Philosophers—provides deep, expert-level insight from their unique analytical framework. The system then synthesizes these diverse perspectives into a unified collective conclusion.Key Features101+ Expert Personas: Pre-configured analytical frameworks spanning physics, philosophy, sociology, economics, law, planning, and moreDeep Analysis: Each persona generates ~250 lines of dense, continuous prose (no bullet points)Collective Synthesis: Final meta-analysis identifying consensus, conflicts, and emergent insightsSource Grounding: Integrates Google Search for factual citationsClient-Side Only: No backend required—runs entirely in browserRate Limit Protection: Configurable throttle delays + exponential backoff retry logicPersistent Settings: Selections and API key stored in localStorageJSON Export: Download complete analysis with metadataQuick StartClone or download this repositoryOpen index.html in a modern web browserGet a Gemini API key from Google AI StudioEnter your API key in the interfaceSelect personas (default: 4, maximum: 101+)Set throttle delay (recommended: 2000ms to avoid rate limits)Enter your topic and click "Start Collective Analysis"Usage ExampleInput:What is your first question to ask if you perceive yourself as living?
Process:System queries 101+ personas sequentially (with throttle delay between calls)Each persona receives specialized system instruction + your topicGemini generates 250-line analysis from that perspectiveProgress bar updates in real-timeOutput:Individual analyses from all personasFinal synthesis identifying cross-cutting themesGrounded web sourcesDownloadable JSON with full resultsSystem RequirementsModern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)Valid Google Gemini API keyStable internet connectionPatience: 101 personas @ 2-second delay = ~3.5 minutesRate LimitingCritical: Google's Gemini API has rate limits. The system includes:User-configurable throttle delay (500ms - 10,000ms)Exponential backoff with up to 5 retries per requestRandom jitter to prevent request clusteringRecommended settings:For testing: 4-10 personas @ 1000ms delayFor full analysis: 101 personas @ 2000-3000ms delayFile Structureemg-analysis-system/
